# USB_Repairer
This Script tries to repair basic errors at the logical level in the USB memory (s).

Is very easy to use I have 2 posibilities:

-> The first option is configured by default on the disks "F :, G :, H :, I: and J:" 
that way it will search among those disks.

-> The second you can put the exact disk you want to repair.
